# Architecture Overview

The API Gateway follows a modular architecture with several key components designed for flexibility, maintainability, and performance.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Core Layer

The foundation of the API Gateway, handling fundamental operations:

- **Phase Handlers**: Manages NGINX request processing phases
- **Route Registry**: Handles dynamic route registration and lookup
- **Specification Loader**: Processes OpenAPI specifications
- **Environment Configuration**: Manages environment-specific settings

### 2. Middleware Layer

Handles request/response processing through a chain of middleware:

- **CORS Middleware**: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Router Middleware**: Manages request routing
- **Request ID Middleware**: Adds unique identifiers to requests
- **Additional middleware**: Can be easily added through the middleware system

### 3. Service Layer

Implements specific API endpoints and business logic:

- **Health Service**: System health monitoring
- **Service-specific handlers**: Custom service implementations
- **OpenAPI specification integration**: Service definition and documentation

### 4. Configuration Layer

Manages system configuration across different scopes:

- **NGINX configuration**: Core server settings
- **Service configurations**: Service-specific settings
- **Security configurations**: Security-related parameters
- **Logging configurations**: Logging and monitoring settings

## Request Flow

1. **Request Reception**

   - NGINX receives the incoming request
   - Basic HTTP processing

2. **Phase Processing**

   - Request passes through NGINX phases
   - Each phase executes registered handlers

3. **Middleware Chain**

   - Request flows through middleware chain
   - Each middleware performs its specific function
   - Chain can be terminated early if needed

4. **Service Handling**

   - Request reaches appropriate service handler
   - Business logic execution
   - Response generation

5. **Response Processing**
   - Response flows back through middleware chain
   - Headers and body can be modified
   - Final response sent to client

## Key Design Principles

1. **Modularity**

   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Independent components
   - Pluggable architecture

2. **Flexibility**

   - Dynamic configuration
   - Extensible middleware system
   - Customizable service handlers

3. **Performance**

   - Efficient request processing
   - Minimal overhead
   - Optimized resource usage

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clear code organization
   - Consistent patterns
   - Comprehensive documentation
